# MLPR_Lab5
Lab 5 – Face Detection &amp; KMeans Clustering
Aim
To detect faces using Haar Cascade and classify them using KMeans clustering based on HSV features.

Methodology

Face detection using OpenCV

Feature extraction (Hue & Saturation)

KMeans clustering (k=2)

Template image classification

Visualization of clusters

Results

Faces successfully detected

Clusters formed using color features

Template image classified into appropriate cluster

Key Findings

HSV features help separate faces

KMeans effectively clusters based on similarity

Template classification works using centroid distance

Conclusion

This lab demonstrates how distance-based learning methods like KMeans can classify images using extracted features.

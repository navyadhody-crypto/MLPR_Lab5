Lab 5 – Face Detection &amp; KMeans Clustering

Aim

To detect faces using Haar Cascade and classify them using KMeans clustering based on HSV features.

Methodology

1..Face detection using OpenCV

2.Feature extraction (Hue & Saturation)

KMeans clustering (k=2)

3.Template image classification

4.Visualization of clusters

Haar Cascade is used to detect facial regions from images. The detected faces are converted into HSV color space to extract meaningful color features. These features are then clustered using KMeans, which groups similar data points based on distance from centroids.
Results

1.Faces successfully detected

2.Clusters formed using color features

3.Template image classified into appropriate cluster

Key Findings

1.HSV features help separate faces

2.KMeans effectively clusters based on similarity

3.Template classification works using centroid distance

Conclusion

This lab demonstrates how distance-based learning methods like KMeans can classify images using extracted features.
